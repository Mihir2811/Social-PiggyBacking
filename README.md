# Social-PiggyBacking

Introducing 'Social Piggybacking,' an exciting machine learning project created during the IIT Gandhinagar Hackathon. Our aim is to improve social media interactions by using advanced algorithms to understand how users behave and what content they like. By doing this, we can cleverly suggest relevant posts and content from one user's feed to others. This makes social media more enjoyable and personalized for everyone involved. We believe 'Social Piggybacking' can bring positive changes to how we connect and share on social platforms, helping us build stronger communities and deeper friendships. We're thrilled about the potential impact of 'Social Piggybacking' in the digital world and beyond.

Problem Statement - 
(A machine learning model that searches the desired feed from the given data set in the form of any social platform dataset.)

The ipynb file named "Social_PiggyBacking" is the final project file where all the machine learning code recides.

traning data2.csv contains the data set used in the machine learning project.
